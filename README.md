# Setting-Z_Height-Z_Offset-for-perfect-First-Layers-
How to get perfect First layers FOR SURE !!!

Everyone has heard of the "famous" Z-Offset.....
But to think of it with respect of First Layers is a BIT mis-leading.
The true thing that matters is the Z_HEIGHT when the printer firmware is at Z=0. But you DO
use the Z_Offset to adjust that.

If Z=0 then why would that not be when the nozzle is RIGHT against the buid plate??? Seeing
being against the "ground" is a height of ZERO !!  And in a Slicer you will set the First Layer
Height, such as 0.28mm, so the nozzle will move UP to that height for printing the First Layer.
Why wasn't Z=0 truly be at the build plate the right and eprfect thing to have?

I don't actually know... it is puzzling... but it is how it is....

What I have found is that the optimal Z_Height for Z=0 is approx 0.025mm !!!
And the optimal way to get this perfectly correct EVERY TIME is to use a feeler gauge set !!!

Forget the "A4 Paper Test" rubbish idea!  That is old school and time wasting!
I expect this idea was "invented" because everyone has a bit of A4 paper around to use. A4 paper
is TOO THICK to be "correct", but what it does is get you CLOSE - too high - so then you can
tweak your way down to the optimal height whilst watching First layers print.  But that is where 
the TIME WASTE comes from!!  That need to PRINT.... heat beds, hotends, waste filament etc....

And in the end... you arrive at 0.025mm... by that trial and error sequrnce you performed....

Do it with a FEELER GAUGE and you don't need to print at all.... don't need to tweak in real-time...
Don't need to clean off poor extrusions fromt eh bnozzle... or scrape dug in, too low, extrusions 
from the plate!!

Sure, set that 0.025mm with a Feeler Gauge and then MAYBE run a print to CHECK and CONFIRM it worked... 
But it will have....

Once set, it should CONTINUWE to work optimally long term!!  Maybe one day "things" will have wandered
off a bit and it needs re-doing, but I find that is rare.
If you change to another build plate, which might be a different thickness, then you will need to 
re-do it. In about 3 minutes.....
